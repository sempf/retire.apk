# retire.apk
retire.apk is a version of retire.js for Android APKs.  It is designed to read the filenames (and eventually the versions) of the libraries in an Android APK, then compare them to a repository of known vulnerable Android libraries.
# It's not even started yet.
I learned how to unzip files and get the list of filenames. That's about it. The rest, I am likely to steal from retire.js (with 100% complete credit).
# Feel free to edit the repository
Send me pulls if you know about vulnerable Android middleware.
